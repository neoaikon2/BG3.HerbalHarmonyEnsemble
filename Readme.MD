It's recommended to use [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), you can find the latest release [HERE](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases).  
1. Open BG3ModManager, and drag-and-drop the Zip file onto the window  
2. The mod should appear as "Whiskeymancy" in the 'Inactive Mods' list, right-click and select 'Allow in Load Order'  
3. In the top menu-bar, click:  
1. File ➡ Save Order (Ctrl+S)
