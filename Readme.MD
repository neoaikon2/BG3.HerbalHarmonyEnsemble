# Baldur's Gate 3 Herbal Harmony Ensemble  
This mod adds the marijuana themed attire to Baldur's Gate 3!  
## What's in the mod  
  
## Where can I find these items?  
Druid Grove Entrance Trader - the guy named Arron, for whatever reason the stuff I make only seems to appear in his inventory and until i can figure it out, it'll be there
  
## Installation  
It's recommended to use [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), you can find the latest release [HERE](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases).  
1. Open BG3ModManager, and drag-and-drop the Zip file onto the window  
2. The mod should appear as "Whiskeymancy" in the 'Inactive Mods' list, right-click and select 'Allow in Load Order'  
3. In the top menu-bar, click:  
1. File ➡ Save Order (Ctrl+S)  
2. File ➡ Export Order to Game (Ctrl+E)  
  
I don't recommended installing it manually, I wouldn't try to do that and I'm the one that made this mod!
